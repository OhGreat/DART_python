Problem definition:
    - reconstructed img size n = w * h
    - projections are sets of detector values for various angles, 
      rotating around the object
    - d : number of projection angles for each 
    - k : number of detector values for each projections
    - m = d*k : number of total measured detector values
    - p = (p_i) : measured data elements for all projections,
                  collapsed as a single vetor
    - projection process maps the image x = (x_i) to p as: W*x = p
    - W = (w_{i,j}) : projection matrix
    - w_{i,j} : weight of the contribution of pixel i with respect to measurement j

Segmentation:
    - R = { ρ_1, ..., ρ_l } where l is the number of gray levels.

    - we take thresholds τ  as mean value between ρ_i and ρ_i+1.

Selection of free pixels:
    - B = {1, ..., n} denotes the 'boundary pixels'
    - N(i) denotes the neighborhood of pixel i (take 8-connected)
    - pixel s_i^t is called a boundary pixel if s_j^t != s_i^t fir at least one j in N(i)
    - U^t in {1, .., n} denotes the 'free pixels' subject to the DART update.
    - initialize U^t = B^t
    - 0 < p <= 1 is the 'fix probability'
    - elements of non-boundary pixels are included in U^t with prob 0 < 1 - p <= 1.
